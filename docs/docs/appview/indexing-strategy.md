# Indexing Strategy

Every `pub.layers.*` commit follows a uniform path: Jetstream frame →
`RawEvent` → `LayersFamily::decode` → `AnyRecord` → `RecordSink` per
backend. The same code path serves every record kind; per-kind
behaviour lives entirely in the lexicon and the generated record type.

## Per-record-kind tables

`PostgresRecordSink::table_for` maps each NSID to its Postgres table
name, e.g. `pub.layers.corpus.corpus` → `corpora`,
`pub.layers.corpus.membership` → `corpus_memberships`. The mapping is
1:1 with the migration set under `layers/migrations/`.

Every table has the same shape — `(uri, did, rkey, indexed_at, record JSONB)`
plus a `did` btree index and a `record` GIN index. Filter columns are
JSONB-resolved on read, not extracted at write time, so adding a new
indexed field only requires updating the orchestrator query (or, for
hot fields, adding a CREATE INDEX on `(record->>'key')`).

## Cross-references

`Neo4jRecordSink` projects typed relationships out of the record body
into the graph. The relationship set is declared in
`crates/layers-storage/src/neo4j.rs::extract_relationships`:

| Relationship          | Source kind            | Target kind          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| `MEMBER_OF`           | corpus.membership      | corpus.corpus        |
| `FOR_EXPRESSION`      | corpus.membership      | expression           |
| `ALIGNS_FROM/_TO`     | alignment.alignment    | any                  |
| `GRAPH_FROM/_TO`      | graph.graphEdge        | any                  |
| `ANNOTATES`           | annotation.layer       | any                  |
| `SEGMENTS`            | segmentation           | any                  |
| `ATTACHED_TO_EPRINT`  | eprint.dataLink        | eprint.eprint        |
| `CITES_CORPUS`        | eprint.eprint          | corpus.corpus        |
| `IN_COLLECTION`       | resource.membership    | resource.collection  |
| `DEFINED_IN`          | ontology.typeDef       | ontology.ontology    |

Adding an edge type is a one-line match arm; the predicate uses the
same JSON body the orchestrator reads.

## Determinism

Every step is idempotent over `(did, collection, rkey)`. `Create` and
`Update` both go through the same `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (uri) DO UPDATE`
upsert; `Delete` is a `DELETE WHERE uri = $1` that is a no-op when the
row is absent. The cursor commit happens after the sink call, so a
crash mid-write replays the same event and produces the same final
state.

## Backfill

A fresh appview starts with no cursor row, which causes Jetstream to
stream from the beginning of the keep-window. Backfill events arrive
flagged `live: false`; `drive_indexer` advances the handler but does
not commit the cursor on backfill, so a subsequent resync starts from
the same point and produces identical state.
