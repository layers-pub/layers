# Guides

These guides provide in-depth coverage of cross-cutting topics in Layers. Each guide explains how multiple lexicons and primitives work together to support a particular capability.

- **[Temporal Representation](./temporal-representation.md)**: Composable temporal primitives for dates, durations, intervals, recurrence, and temporal relations (Allen's Interval Algebra). Maps to TimeML, OWL-Time, and ISO 8601.

- **[Spatial Representation](./spatial-representation.md)**: Composable spatial primitives for geographic coordinates, regions, paths, and spatial relations (RCC-8). Maps to GeoJSON, WKT, ISO-Space, SpatialML, and computer vision formats.

- **[Multimodal Annotation](./multimodal-annotation.md)**: How the polymorphic anchor type supports annotation across text, audio, video, image, and paged documents. Covers media records, temporal and spatial anchoring, and practical examples.

- **[Knowledge Grounding](./knowledge-grounding.md)**: Linking annotations to external knowledge bases (Wikidata, FrameNet, WordNet), building typed property graphs, defining ontologies, and the entity grounding workflow.
